# Changelog

## Added

- Added the schema-driven **Protocol Generator GUI** wizard that authors `ProtocolFile.json` through `Step 1 General`, `Step 2 Loading`, and `Step 3 Processing`.
- Added lifecycle persistence with debounced autosave, temporary draft storage, startup draft recovery prompt, and atomic writes for target save paths.
- Added inline validation UX including per-step completion/error indicators, top-level progress summary, and first-invalid-field focus behavior.
- Added contextual help UX with per-step Help panels plus schema/metadata-backed field tooltips.
- Added packaging/build scaffolding (`pyproject.toml`, `build_windows_exe.ps1`) and CI-backed pytest coverage enforcement.

## Changed

- Changed wizard interaction flow to require **Save As** before progressing beyond Step 1 so autosave and subsequent edits target a user-selected file.
- Changed destructive workflow-step actions to explicit confirmation dialogs (**Confirm delete**, **Confirm reorder**) and added keyboard shortcuts (`Enter` to advance tab from entry fields, `Esc` to cancel pending autosave).
- Changed documentation set with a root README plus dedicated end-user and developer guides aligned to current command usage and UI labels.

## Fixed

- Fixed Windows EXE packaging by invoking PyInstaller with `python -m PyInstaller` in `build_windows_exe.ps1`, avoiding PATH-related `pyinstaller` command resolution failures.
- Fixed coverage gate reliability by excluding the Tkinter shell module from measured coverage while retaining test depth on schema, validation, persistence, and wizard logic modules.
